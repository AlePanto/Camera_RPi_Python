# Camera_RPi

This project show you how to use your Raspberry-Pi (RPi) on a closed-circuit television (CCTV). I used my windows desktop to remote access the RPi with VNC viewer. The RPi is connected to a USB camera that is mounted on two axis arm. The arm is moved by stepper motors connected to the RPi. To remote control the this system I developed a TKinter graphical user interface (GUI).

The GUI allows to:
- turn on and off the camera
- turn on and off a relay
- control 2 different steper motors with PWM

# Materials:
1. Raspberry-Pi
2. USB type camera
3. 2 stepper motors
4. 2 stepper motor drives
