# Camera_RPi

Beginner python programming project: Camera Motion Control.

The project intention is to use a Raspberry-Pi (RPi) on a closed-circuit television (CCTV). I used my windows desktop to remote access the RPi with VNC viewer. The RPi is connected to a USB camera that is mounted on a two axis arm. The arm is moved by stepper motors connected to the RPi. To remote control the this system I developed a TKinter graphical user interface (GUI).


As the picture bellow show the GUI let you:
- Start and Finish the camera video
- turn on and off a relay (VFD ON/OFF)
- control movement of 2 different steper motors (<< >>)
