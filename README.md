# Camera_RPi
The problem 


# Materials:
1. Raspberry-Pi
2. USB type camera
3. 2 stepper motors
4. 2 stepper motor drives
5. relay

Create a graphical user interface (GUI) with tkinter. I used an USB camera. The camera get mounted on two axis driven by steper motors.

The GUI allows to:
- turn on and off the camera
- turn on and off a relay
- control 2 different steper motors with PWM
